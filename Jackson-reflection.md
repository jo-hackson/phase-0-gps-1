What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Git workflow is challenging for me to understand. For personal use, I can understand the basic workflow but when you start to add in a team and other members, then it begins to get a bit more complicated. But going through the GPS session with Regina and talking through things, I think that I will be able to have a better understanding with more practice as well.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Everything! I learn by speaking out loud and talking through things with people. I really like the structure of the GPS and how I am able to get instant feedback from Regina. A more specific concept that I got clarity is on merge conflicts.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I worked with Regina on my own so I was asking many questions during the time we had together. Some main questions I had was Git workflow (addressed in question 1) and what to do in what branch.

What still confuses you about Git?

Workflow will take some time to get used to but with practice and paying attention to what branch I am on, I hope to improve and become more efficient.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great. I read through the exercise prior to the session, so I was a bit skeptical as to how it would work with just me and Regina. But it was great to be able to work one on one with her and be able to have all the attention.
